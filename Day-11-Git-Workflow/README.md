## What Git is

Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files and coordinates work among multiple developers. It allows you to save snapshots of your project over time, revert to previous versions, and work on different features simultaneously through branching.

## What GitHub is

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides collaboration tools for developers. It adds features like pull requests, issue tracking, project management, and social coding capabilities on top of Git's version control functionality.

## What I practiced today

- Creating and structuring a professional Git repository
- Writing clean, GitHub-ready documentation (README.md and design.md)
- Organizing project files following industry-standard conventions
- Understanding repository structure and best practices
- Preparing technical documentation for version control

## Why Git matters for professionals

Git is the industry-standard version control system used by virtually every software development team and tech company worldwide. It enables professionals to:

- **Collaborate effectively** - Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts
- **Track history** - Every change is recorded with who made it, when, and why
- **Experiment safely** - Create branches to try new ideas without breaking working code
- **Recover from mistakes** - Revert to any previous state of the project instantly
- **Demonstrate skills** - A well-maintained GitHub profile serves as a portfolio for employers
- **Contribute to open source** - Join global development communities and learn from experts
- **Deploy professionally** - Most CI/CD pipelines and deployment systems integrate directly with Git
