# Day 10 — Linux Networking Basics (Execution Restart)

## Overview
This day marks the restart of my execution phase in the 60-Day Tech Mastery journey.  
The focus of Day 10 is understanding how Linux systems interact with networks using core diagnostic tools.

Rather than learning networking theory again, I applied previously learned concepts through hands-on practice and documentation.

---

## Objectives
- Inspect network interfaces on a Linux system
- Understand IP addressing and routing at a basic level
- Test network connectivity using standard tools
- Identify open ports and listening services
- Relate networking tools to cybersecurity and cloud environments

---

## Environment
- Host OS: Windows
- Virtualization: VirtualBox
- Guest OS: Kali Linux
- Network Mode: NAT

---

## Tools Used
- `ip`
- `ping`
- `ss`
- Linux terminal (Bash)

---

## Practical Tasks Completed
- Viewed active network interfaces and IP addresses
- Checked default routing and gateway
- Tested internet connectivity using DNS and direct IP
- Inspected open ports and listening services

All commands executed during this session are documented in `commands.txt`.

---

## Security Perspective
From a cybersecurity point of view:
- Network interfaces reveal attack surfaces
- Open ports represent potential entry points
- Connectivity tests such as ping are commonly used during reconnaissance
- Understanding these tools is critical for both attackers and defenders

---

## Cloud Relevance
The same networking tools are used to:
- Diagnose cloud VM connectivity issues
- Verify firewall and security group rules
- Troubleshoot service availability on servers

---

## Evidence
- Command history: `commands.txt`
- This README serves as documentation proof

---

## Skills Gained
- Linux network inspection
- Basic network troubleshooting
- Security-aware system observation
- Technical documentation discipline

---

## Status
✅ Day 10 completed
